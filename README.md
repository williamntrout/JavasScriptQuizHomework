# JavasScriptQuizHomework

Tasked with making a basic quiz using JavaScript, about JavaScript, proved to be anything other than basic.  

I was able to meet most of the parameters.  My site loads, has a timer, is reactive, cycles through questions on its own power, and moves from message box to message box as required.  

I however was not able to work out how to make the timer stop when the quiz is finished nor can I figure out how to get the system to calculate the score I want and store it on the leaderboard.

I will however get it figured out.
